# Gold recovery rate prediction
## Data
The following datasets were used:
* gold_recovery_train
* gold_recovery_test
* gold_recovery_full
They contain data with mining and cleaning parameters

## Project description
A model needs to be developed that can predict the recovery rate of gold from gold ore

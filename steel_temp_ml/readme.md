# Steel temperature prediction
## Project description
It is necessary to build a model that predicts the temperature of the steel in order to optimize production costs.
## Status
Done
## Goals
## Required libraries
pandas, numpy, scikit learn, lightgbm, matplotlib, seaborn
## Conclusion
## Data
The following datasets were used:
* data on electrodes
* data on the supply of bulk materials (volume)
* data on the supply of bulk materials (time)
* data on gas blowing of the alloy
* temperature measurement results
* data on wire materials (volume)
* wire material data (time)

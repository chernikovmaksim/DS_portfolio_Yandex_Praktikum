# Steel temperature prediction
## Data
The following datasets were used:
* data_arc.csv - data on electrodes
* data_bulk.csv - data on the supply of bulk materials (volume)
* data_bulk_time.csv - data on the supply of bulk materials (time)
* data_gas.csv - data on gas blowing of the alloy
* data_temp.csv - temperature measurement results
* data_wire.csv - data on wire materials (volume)
* data_wire_time.csv - wire material data (time)

## Project description
It is necessary to build a model that predicts the temperature of the steel in order to optimize production costs.

## Required libraries
pandas, numpy, scikit learn, lightgbm, matplotlib, seaborn

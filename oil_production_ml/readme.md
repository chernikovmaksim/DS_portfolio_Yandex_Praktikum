# Oil production
## Data
The following datasets were used:
Geological prospecting data for three regions:
• geo_data_0
• geo_data_1
• geo_data_2

## Project description
It is necessary to build a machine learning model that will help determine the region where oil production will bring the greatest profit. It is also necessary to analyze the possible profit and risks using the Bootstrap technique.

## Required libraries
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy

This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Yandex Praktikum in 2020. As part of the training, I independently completed 18 projects that were reviewed by experienced mentors. I have selected the most difficult and interesting of them so that you have the opportunity to evaluate my skills.

The Yandex Praktikum Data Science program prepares me for a career as a Data Scientist, helping me learn how to cleanse and organize data, analyze it, test hypotheses, find patterns and relationships, select features, build forecasting and classification models, choose a suitable algorithm, select hyperparameters for models, work with images, text and flat tables and etc.

## Technology stack 
Python, Jupyter notebook, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PostgreSQL, Scikit learn, LightGBM, Catboost, Keras, PyTorch, pymystem3, collections

Tips: If you want to run this code localy, I would recomend you to install Anaconda and use Jupyter Notebook with it's basic libraries: numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn. Libraries may vary depending on the projects. By the way, Yandex prohibits uploading source datasets, so you won't see them here.

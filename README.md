## Yandex Praktikum: https://praktikum.yandex.ru/

This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Yandex Praktikum in 2020. As part of the training, I independently completed 18 projects that were reviewed by experienced mentors.

The Yandex Praktikum Data Science program prepares me for a career as a Data Scientist, helping me learn how to cleanse and organize data, analyze it, test hypotheses, find patterns and relationships, select features, build forecasting and classification models, choose a suitable algorithm, select hyperparameters for models, work with images, text and flat tables and etc.

## Technology stack: 
Python, Jupyter notebook, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PostgreSQL, Scikit learn, LightGBM, Catboost, Keras, PyTorch, pymystem3, collections

Tips: If you want to run this code localy, I would recomend you to install Anaconda and use Jupyter Notebook with it's basic libraries: numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn. By the way, Yandex prohibits uploading source datasets, so you won't see them here. 


## Projects:
## ML
1) Develop an ML model that predicts the temperature at the final stage of steel processing
2) Develop an ML model that predicts the churn of bank customers
3) Develop an ML model that predicts the recovery rate of gold from a gold ore
4) Develop an ML model with which you can find out the market value of your car
5) Develop an ML model for predicting the number of taxi orders for the next hour
6) Develop an ML model for classifying comments into positive and negative (NLP)
